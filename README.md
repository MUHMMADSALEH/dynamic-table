## Getting Started

# Invoice Management System

This project is a React-based Invoice Management System using Material-UI (MUI) components. It provides functionalities to create, edit, delete, and filter invoices with a clean and responsive user interface.

## Features

- **Create New Invoice:** Users can create new invoices with client details, status, total amount, issued date, and balance.
- **Edit Invoice:** Edit client details, invoice status, total, and issued date.
- **Delete Invoice:** Users can delete an invoice with confirmation.
- **Filter Invoices:** Invoices can be filtered by status (`Paid`, `Pending`, `Overdue`) or searched by client name and invoice ID.
- **Select Invoices:** Bulk select invoices for future operations.
- **Material-UI Components:** The UI is styled with Material-UI components and custom-styled elements.

## Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) - A popular React UI framework
- TypeScript - Type-safe implementation of React components

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v12 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) - Dependency management

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/invoice-management.git
   cd invoice-management


2.Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
